		Here's  how the launch went for those that couldn't make it:
		<br />
		We started the final prep Saturday morning. One of our altimeters went bad but someone loaned us an 
		even better altimeter which was quickly installed. Everything went according to 
		plans until we realized we forgot the things to attach the chutes. Luckily Devin 
		used his boy scout skills to tie us a special knot. So we got the rocket on the 
		rail, filled it, and began launch sequences.
		
		<br />
		<br />
		
		After the countdown, the rocket had a perfect ignition and began to take off. As I was 
		in the blockhouse I watched it light and start up the rail. I went outside to 
		see how high it went but then Carl and Steve instantly started heading back under 
		cover. The rocket went up but it's thrust started to decrease to zero and the 
		rocket came back down. It the ground hard but did not explode. We waited a while 
		but there was no explosion so we had a tractor move it to let the liquid oxygen 
		evaporate. The rocket's propellant basically started flowing less and less until 
		it just completely stopped. We 
		have lots of footage, (including the footage from onboard) of the rocket leaving 
		the rail, hovering, and then descending. Our altimeters showed that we reached 
		100ft. which is progress. We have 3 theories as to what happened.
		<br />
		After taking apart the rocket we can easily determine which one it was:
		
		<br />
		<br />
		
		<ol class="numbered-list">
		<li>The regulators failed or were not properly set.</li>
		<li>Check valves failed.</li>
		<li>Rust clogged the fuel injection.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<br />
		If anyone has pics or video could you send me a copy. Also, we will have a rocket 
		meeting in the near future to discuss what's next and what happened. Don't get 
		discouraged. It took Garvey 5 rockets to finally get one up and back safely so 
		having our second rocket work perfect would have been amazing. Most of the professionals 
		there said that to get as far as we did with that rocket is pretty impressive.

		23, 2004<br> <br> Hello everyone!<br> <br> Well, the launch is now over and I 
		thank all the people that came and helped out. Here's how it went:<br> <br> Beginning 
		early saturday we began finish some hatch work on the rocket to make them fit 
		better. Then we started arming pyros and packing chutes. Everything was going 
		fine until we loaded the rocket on the rail and began fueling it with kerosene. 
		The instant we began fueling we saw the kerosene pour out of the motor. It turns 
		out one of the valves was accidentally attached wrong after cleaning the motor 
		so that it opened when it was supposed to be closed. This was a plm because our 
		motor mount bolts were already tightened to their yield point and so they could 
		not be reused. HOwever we had to clean the motor because it was now full of kerosene 
		and could not be fired. Luckily Dave Crisalli had the exact bolts that we needed 
		and so we were able to take off the rocket motor and clean it once again. After 
		reattaching the motor we filled the rocket with kerosene and then the LOX and 
		then the countdown began. Do you remember Machezuma? Well that is what happened 
		this time except the explosion was much more minute, and we vented the tanks and 
		shut the propellant valves a second later, saving most of the rocket. As of right 
		now we're still investigating the cause, but we do know that the explosion happened 
		in between the injector plate and the LOX dome.<br> <br> We should have another 
		launch in december or january and luckily the entire rocket is salvagable except 
		for the plumbing around the motor. After the explosion the altemeters accidentally 
		fired off the nosecone and it worked flawlessly. So although we did not get to 
		launch the rocket we now know that our recover system works and we will hope to 
		see it in action in December.<br> <br> Thanks once again to everyone that came 
		and made this possible. We will soon hold a rocket meeting and discuss plans for 
		the next launch. I'm sorry things didn't work out perfectly. This is our third 
		rocket and to have a perfectly successful liquid rocket work on the third try 
		would have still been amazing. If you have any pictures or videos, send them to 
		me because i will need them for the AIAA meeting in a week.<br> <br> Keep checking 
		your mail for future updates and work days.<br> <br> Joey Brown<br> Project Manager
