		It appears that the rocket engine that was donated to us from the
		<a href="http://www.aerospacemuseum.org/" target="_blank">San Diego Aerospace Museum</a>
		was a little rusty, so shortly after liftoff, the fuel filter plugged up and
		the engine liner burned through. This reduced the thrust and the flame got
		much longer as the fuel burned outside the engine. All in all a spectacular
		flight! Thanks to
		<a href="http://www.netburner.com/" target="_blank">Netburner</a>
		for the telemetry system and
		<a href="http://www.shadowaero.com/" target="_blank">Shadow Aero</a>
		for the parachute. As always thanks to Dave Crissali for help with the
		launch facility, Kevin Baxter and
		<a href="http://far.pyroinnovations.com/" target="_blank">F.A.R.</a>
		for the use of his launch rail, and Carl Tedesco for teaching the students
		about rocket technology. CSULB and
		<a href="http://www.garvspace.com/" target="_blank">Garvey Spacecraft</a>
		had an excellent launch of their Nanosat Launch Vehicle mockup that day
		as well.

		Delta-Phoenix Rocket Project: On Saturday, May 21, 2005, the San Diego State 
		University student rocket project launched the Delta-Phoenix, a 1000 lbf. thrust 
		liquid bi-propellant rocket, in the Mojave desert. The launch proved to be spectacular 
		and dramatic. Some preliminary videos and pictures are posted on the SDSU Rocket 
		Project website. The SDSU rocket project website is in the process of being updated 
		so periodically check back.<br> <br> The rocket is based on the LR-101 motor used 
		on the Atlas rocket for attitude control. It is a regenerative cooled engine, 
		which means the fuel is circulated around the motor casing to cool it. The LR-101 
		burns liquid oxygen (LOX) as its oxidizer and aviation kerosene (Jet-A) as its 
		fuel. High pressure helium is used to pressurize the two propellants. The propellants 
		are stored in two stainless steel tanks. These tanks are custom made from surplus 
		fire extinguishers. They are hydro-tested several times to over 600 psi. The LOX 
		tank has a 9 gallon capacity and the Jet-A has a 6 gallon capacity. The high pressure 
		helium is stored in a composite cylinder rated at 4500 psi. The helium is regulated 
		from the cylinder through a pair of high-flow pressure regulators. The LOX helium 
		supply is regulated to 525 psi and the Jet-A helium supply is regulated to 485 
		psi. Each tank has a pressure relief and pneumatically actuated vent valve. Both 
		tanks supply propellant to a pair of pneumatically actuated ball valves. The LOX 
		ball valve initiates a sequence valve which initiates the actuation of the Jet-A 
		valve; this assures the proper sequence of propellants entering the combustion 
		chamber. <br> <br> The rocket's airframe is composed of four 1-inch square aluminum 
		extruded stringers joined to 11 wood bulkheads. The entire airframe is covered 
		with 0.025 inch aluminum skin which is pop-riveted to the stringers. Aluminum 
		hatches were installed near critical or serviceable components. The fins were 
		made from epoxy/carbon-fiber covered balsa wood. The nosecone was purchased commercially. 
		The recovery system consisted of a 60" X-style drogue and a 18' diameter 
		main parachute. The nosecone had it's own 48" diameter parachute. The activation 
		of the recovery system was done with two G-Wiz fight computers. <br> <br> The 
		rocket was transported to the RRS-Mojave Test Area the day before the launch. 
		It under went final assembly, integration and checkout Friday evening. On Saturday 
		morning the parachutes and recovery systems were installed and armed. All pre-launch 
		activities went very smoothly. The Delta-Phoenix rocket would be second that day 
		to launch after the CSULB P6 rocket . <br> <br> Sometime in the early afternoon 
		the Delta-Phoenix was carried to the 50' tall mobile launch rail. Jet-A fuel was 
		loaded first and then LOX was loaded. In the final minutes a regulator failed 
		that was used to actuate the GSE (ground support equipment). CSULB was kind enough 
		to lend us a regulated cylinder of air and we were back on schedule. High pressure 
		helium was then remotely loaded onto the rocket. The remote disconnect of the 
		helium fill line failed to actuate and had to be manually disconnected. Road and 
		air checks were made and a 10 second count down began. At T-5 second the pyro-lance 
		igniter was lit.<br> <br> Winds were light (0 to 5 mph), temperatures were around 
		100 F and skies were clear. Perfect weather for a launch. At T-0, the rocket motor 
		roared to life perfectly, however, as the rocket started to move up the launch 
		rail the exhaust plume immediately diminished to about 1 or 2 feet long. When 
		the rocket was just about to leave the launch rail, the exhaust plume suddenly 
		grew to over 20' long. After leaving the nearly vertical rail, the rocket arched 
		over and began to fly a rather flat and level ballistic trajectory. The motor 
		burned for ~15 seconds and the rocket impacted the ground 18.1 seconds into the 
		flight at a shallow angle. There was no indication that the recovery systems were 
		initiated. A small brush fire started and was quickly put out. The point of impact 
		was 0.98 miles due south-southeast of the launch site. The debris field covered 
		about a quarter of an acre. All debris except the helium tank was recovered and 
		hauled away. The peak altitude determined from the telemetry data was ~800 feet.<br> 
		<br> Post video and data analysis and inspection of the motor (recovered intact) 
		showed that the motor experienced an anomaly. At ignition, it is believed that 
		rust was liberated from the internal fuel passages in the motor and partially 
		blocked the fuel manifold ports on the injector plate (a screen filter prevented 
		the fuel injector holes from being clogged directly). Post inspection of the motor 
		found small rust fragments in the fuel manifold just prior to entering the injector 
		plate. At this point 25 GPM of LOX and only a small amount of fuel are flowing 
		into the combustion chamber. Since the motor depends on significant fuel flow 
		through it's internal passages for cooling, the throat section of the nozzle experienced 
		a burn through. This can be seen on the flight videos when the rocket is just 
		about to leave the rail and the exhaust plume instantly grows to about 20'. It 
		seems that the burn-through in the motor nozzle caused significant thrust asymmetry 
		which was most likely the reason the rocket arced over when it left the launch 
		rail. Also, from the acceleration data obtained by the telemetry the motor never 
		developed the full thrust except for the brief moment after ignition (~15-20 msec). 
		Using the average mass of the rocket through out the flight the average thrust 
		of the rocket was estimated to be about 350 to 450 lbf, far below the nominal 
		1000 lbf. The motor was donated to the project by the San Diego Aerospace Museum. 
		It's history was unknown and there is speculation that it was from the Atlas that 
		used to stand in front of the Convair building in San Diego for 30+ years.<br>
