	<h1>About</h1>
	
	We are a club on San Diego State University Campus. As students we design, build, and launch a rocket with the assistance of our advisor. Every year we look to improve upon our past rockets and use industry leading technology. We currently have 40 active members who collaborate on different systems of our rocket.
